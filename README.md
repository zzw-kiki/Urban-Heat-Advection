# **Computation framework of UHA (Urban Heat Advection)**
The theoretical computational framework and data analysis code for the UHA effect, including wind direction statistics, temperature and height statistics, buffer zone analysis, quantification of the UHA effect using regression model residuals, correlation analysis, error analysis, and the preprocessing and extraction of temperature and height data, were all performed in ArcGIS Pro.
